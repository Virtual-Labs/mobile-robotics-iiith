		<p><b>What is Kinematics?</b></p>
		
		<p>Kinematics is the science of motion that studies properties of motion without considering the forces that act to cause such motion. The scope of
kinematics includes position, velocity, acceleration and other higher\ order derivatives of position with respect to time and other variables.</p>

<p><b>What are the popular methods of modelling and analyzing kinematics?</b> </p>

<p>Two of the most popular methods of kinematic modelling and analysis are the forward and inverse kinematic models.</p>


<p> <b>What is Forward kinematics?</b> </p>
<p>In
the context of this VL experiment forward kinematics addresses the following question: If the various motors on the robot turn so much, where would the robot be or where would a point on the robot be? More formally given the velocities commanded to the motors on the robot the forward kinematic problem computes the position evolution of a reference point on the robot over time as a result of such commanded velocities</p>

<p><b>What is inverse kinematics?</b></p>
<p>Inverse
kinematics computes the velocities to be commanded to the motor so that the robot can reach a given location. More formally given an ending configuration of the robot pose the inverse kinematics problem seeks to find a set of wheel/motor velocities and positions that would enable the robot to reach that ending configuration.

        <p> <b>What is a Differential drive robot?</b> </p>
		
		<p align="center"> <img style="height:320px; width:320px;" alt="" src="FK_images/img1.jpg" align="middle"> </p>
		
		<p>Differential drive is the common drive mechanism used in mobile robots. It consists of 2 drive wheels mounted on a common axis, and each wheel can independently being driven either forward or back-ward.</p>
	
        <p>Since each wheel is independent we can vary the velocity of each wheel, for the robot to perform rolling motion, the robot must rotate about a point that lies along their common left and right wheel axis.</p>
        
        <p>This point about which  the robot rotates about is known as the ICC - Instantaneous Center Of Curvature</p>
        
        <p align="center"> <img style="height:467px; width:486px;" src="FK_images/img2.jpg"  align="middle"> </p>
        
        <p>By varying the velocities of the two wheels, we can vary the trajectories that the robot takes. Because the rate of rotation ω about the ICC must be the same for both wheels, we can write the following equations:</p>
        
        
        <p align="center"> <img  style="height:120px; width:227px;" src="FK_images/img3.jpg" align="middle">
        
        <p align="center">where 2d is the distance between the centers of the two wheels, V<sub>R</sub>, V<sub>L</sub> are the right and left wheel velocities along the ground, and R is the signed distance from the ICC to the midpoint between the wheels. At any instance in time we can solve for R and ω:</p>
        
        <p align="center"> <img style ="height:105px;  width:396px;" src="FK_images/img4.jpg"  align="middle">
        </p> 
        <p align="center"><img
      style="height:380px;  width:800px;" src="FK_images/img6.jpg"  align="middle"> </p>
        
        <p align="center"> There are interesting cases with these kinds of drives. <br> </p>
        <ol>
       		 <li>If <b>V<sub>L</sub>=V<sub>R</sub></b>, then we have forward linear motion in a straight line. R becomes infinite, and there is effectively no rotation - ω is zero.</li>

			<li>If <b>V<sub>L</sub>&lt;V<sub>R</sub></b>, then R is finite and we have rotation about the point which is to the left of the left wheel along the axis.</li>
			<li> If <b>V<sub>L</sub>&gt;V<sub>R</sub></b>, then R is finite and we have rotation about the point which is to the right of the right wheel along the axis.</li>
			<li>If <b>V<sub>L</sub>=-V<sub>R</sub></b>, then we have rotation about the midpoints ofthe wheels.</li>

		<p> <b> Derive forward kinematics for differential drive?</b></p>        
        
        <p>Assume that initial position of the robot is 0,0. When the wheels are given velocities say V<sub>L</sub> and V<sub>R</sub> respectively. The position of the robot after time <b>t</b> would be derived in the following way: </p>

        	  <p>What is Ackerman Steeting?<br></p>
        	  
        	  <p>Ackerman steering  is the type of steering found on most automobiles. In this model, the front steering wheels each rotate on seprate arms so as to able to rotate different amounts to point at ICC, which must lie on the line passing through a larger angle axis of the vehicle. In this VL we discuss about the tricycle steering model<br></p>
        	  
        	  <p align="center"><img style="height:299px; width: 448px;" alt="img10"  src="FK_images/img10.jpg"></p>
        	  
        	  <p>Tricycle
drive is the common case in the mobile robots. It consists of one steering front wheel and two rear wheels (free wheels). The robot motion is controlled by the steering wheel's velocity <b>V<sub>F</sub></b> and the direction <b>α</b>.</p>


			<p>These controls produce a ICC along the axis of the rear wheels as shown below.<br></p>
			
			<p align="center"><img  style="height:495px; width:448px;" alt="img11"  src="FK_images/img11.jpg"></p>
        	  
        	  
        	<p>The effect of these controls on the other parameters of the robot like <b>V<sub>L</sub></b>, <b>V<sub>R</sub></b>, <b>ω</b> are shown below.</p>
