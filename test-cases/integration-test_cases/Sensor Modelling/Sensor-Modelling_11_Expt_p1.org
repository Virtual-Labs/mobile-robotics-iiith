  +  Processor:i5

* Objective

   + To be able to simulate the "Sensor Modelling" experiment
     
* Pre conditions

  +  Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/mobile-robotics-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Sensor%20Modelling_01_Usability_smk.org][Sensor Modelling_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions

  +  Nil
     
* Test Steps

  +  Click on the "Simulation" link.
  +  Check if there are any distortions, spelling mistakes and junk
     characters in the Simulation page.
  +  Change the "Error Variance" 

* Expected result

  + Simulation page should be displayed on the screen.
  + Content should be present with no distortions, spelling mistakes and Junk characters.
  + The user should be able to use the Error variance slider with
